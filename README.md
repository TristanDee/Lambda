# Lambda Restaurant Web Page

My first truly responsive mark-up.

Discarded Bootstrap entirely.

Screen break-points are set at -
    1200px
    900px
    650px
    500px
    420px
 
 NOTE: DateDropper UI not working properly. It's supposed to adopt site theme colour of gold, but it isn't. ALSO, the OK button, Shorten/Enlarge buttons, and Prev/Next buttons are not taking the default icons. Don't know why.
